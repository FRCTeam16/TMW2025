# Robot Configuration Selection

This directory contains the generated robot configurations. The TunerConstants configurations are generated by the CTRE
Phoenix X tool. 

In order to register a new configuration, you must perform the following steps:
1. Generate the configuration using the CTRE Phoenix X tool
2. Rename the TunerConstants file to something descriptive of its config
3. Copy the generated file into this directory
4. Remove the public access modifier from the class
5. Add an entry to the `RobotConfig` enum in `RobotConfig.java`
6. Add the name to enum lookup to the constructor of the `RobotConfig` class
7. Update the methods switch statement in `RobotConfig.java` to handle the new configuration
